# WarriorRPG

I started this small project by myself in Summer 2018. I just made a small shooter game to brush up on Java skills, and have some fun with coding. It's far from finished, but I add little improvements here and there. Basically, it has a character on the screen that is moved by the WASD keys and shoots bullets aimed by the mouse. It is all done from scratch.
